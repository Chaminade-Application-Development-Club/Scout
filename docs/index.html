<p>This is the advanced programming experiment lab of team1138. We create things even cooler than the robots! Now we have the scouting app for VEX 2016-2017, in the future we will have more talented wheels.  </p>

<p>There are Leo Hu(<a href="https://github.com/Leo428" class="user-mention">@Leo428</a>) and Nicholas Berberi in the lab right now. We are the authors of the scouting apps. </p>

<p>This is a scouting app for team 1138. Now it is only for VEX 2016-2017 StarTrucks game, later on it will be a combination of different games. It is also a fundamental app for the future machine learning project.</p>

<p>If you are the next programmer who will be in charge of this program, I suggest you just give it up! 
......
Well, if you are still here for whatever reason then let's continue. 
First, it will be hard to understand the code since it is explicit and well written, yet not well commented. That means you want to read and understand the methods in the code and all the naming for variables. You will see the comments in both Chinese and English and sometimes it doesn't clear answer your questions. That's because my comments are not Artificial Intelligent programs like BlackBoard or Dyknow(ask Ms. Lota for further understanding). </p>

<p>Which means that you really should do researches online especially [<a href="https://developer.android.com/index.html">https://developer.android.com/index.html</a>] for API details!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>......
Further improvement on codes and comments is coming unless I quit the Robotics team, so leave problems in issues section or send me emails or talk to me in person if you dare for any ideas, issues or suggestions!</p>

<p>Huge thanks for Nicholas Berberi, who worked hard and contributed a lot on designing and programming, best memory of programming on Oct 15, 2016. </p>
